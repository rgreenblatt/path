Maybe z cut isn't important at all...
x: 
 - edge type
 - y min max
 - x value
 - sorted by x value

y:
 - edge type
 - x min max
 - y value
 - sorted by y value

z min sort:
 - x min max
 - y min max
 - sorted by z min

z max sort:
 - x min max
 - y min max
 - inv sorted by z max

t_c: traversal cost
c_l: count left
c_r: count left
p_l: prob
p_r: count left


x (also y) cut: 
 - use prefix sum to know count_left and count_right
 - cost heuristic is:
 t_cost + i_cost (area_left count_left + area_right count_right) / total_area

 area can be simplified to distance along only the dimension which is cut

 - split x
 - filter all y/z for each side
