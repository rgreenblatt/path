Started many jobs as we now have a decent prototype (of the most basic thing).
Seems like wider is better. No multiplier is way worse. 
mse vs perceptual loss probably doesn't matter much, will keep perceptual for now.
Celu for output doesn't seem better, just keep Relu.
More mul size doesn't seem better.
Larger output multiplier doesn't seem better.

Residual connection is important (no real surprise here...)
