# Path

This project consists of a GPU pathtracer in C++ with CUDA and Python code using PyTorch for fitting a deep model to solve global illumination.
The GPU pathtracer is used to generate data for training.
In the end, I had a very hard time getting the deep model to learn the geometery needed to solve the problem.
C++ code can be found under `src/` while python code for training a deep model can be found under `neural_render/`
