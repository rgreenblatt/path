# Project Plan

## Summary

I am planning on implementing a pool (game) scene.  The scene will allow for
randomly shooting the cue ball with reasonably realistic ball interactions and
friction. The ball materials will be configurable and include standard pool
ball textures, glass, and metallic. The scene will be gpu ray traced with
shadows and reflection.

## New Features

  - GPU raytracing 
  - Collision detection

## Already Covered Features
